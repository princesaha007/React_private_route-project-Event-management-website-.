B: ReferenceError: greetign is not defined

Explanation: In the code, you attempted to assign an empty object to a variable called "greetign" (note the typo in the variable name), but you mistakenly misspelled the variable name as "greetign" instead of "greeting." As a result, JavaScript treats "greetign" as an undeclared variable, leading to a ReferenceError.

2. 
A: NaN

Explanation: In the provided code, the sum function is designed to add two numbers. However, when you call sum(1, "2"), you are attempting to add a number (1) to a string ("2"). JavaScript performs type coercion in this case and converts the number 1 to a string to perform the concatenation operation, resulting in the string "12". When you try to add a number and a string together, the result is not a valid numeric calculation, and JavaScript returns NaN (Not-a-Number).

3.
A: ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the first element of the food array ("🍕") to the info.favoriteFood property. Later, it updates the info.favoriteFood property to "🍝". However, this change does not affect the original food array. Therefore, when you log the food array, it remains unchanged, containing the original elements: ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔'].
